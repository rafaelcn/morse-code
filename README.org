* Purpose

Implement a simple encoder/decoder of Morse code.

* Building

You gonna need a C++ compiler complacent with the fourteenth standard
(/C++14/) and maybe CMake if you will.

** Building with CMake

To build with CMake it is pretty straight forward, you just need to do:

```
cmake ./
make
```

** Building without CMake

You can either compile it directly with the compiler in hands

```
g++ -Wall -pedantic -std=c++14 src/main.cpp src/morse.cpp -o bin/morse.out
```

Or you can open the source files on a IDE of choice and compile them.


* What is already done?

[x] Encoder of Latin based alphabet to Morse code
[] Decode Morse code to latin based alphabet

** Roadmap

[] Implement a way to decode multiple words
[] Implement the decode function

* Problems

It is only encoding one word at time, I will fix that later, and the decode
function is not ready yet.
